# Solver-Performance-Multigrid-vs-CG



In this project we compare the performances of solvers based on the metrics of execution time and number of iterations taken to convergerve below a certain tolerance limit.
We compare the performances of the following solvers.
1) Multigrid Solver parallelized with OpenACC
2) Red-Black Solver parallelized with OpenACC
3) Conjugate Gradient Solver.
